<h2 id="c2">ABOUT PARROTS.</h2>
<p>Naturalists place the parrot group at
the head of bird creation. This is done,
not, of course, because parrots can talk,
but because they display, on the whole,
a greater amount of intelligence, of
cleverness and adaptability to circumstances
than other birds, including even
their cunning rivals, the ravens and
the jackdaws.</p>
<p>It may well be asked what are the causes
of the exceptionally high intelligence in
parrots. The answer which I suggest is
that an intimate connection exists
throughout the animal world between
mental development and the power of
grasping an object all round, so as to
know exactly its shape and its tactile
properties. The possession of an effective
prehensile organ&mdash;a hand or its
equivalent&mdash;seems to be the first great
requisite for the evolution of a high order
of intellect. Man and the monkeys,
for example, have a pair of hands; and
in their case one can see at a glance how
dependent is their intelligence upon these
grasping organs. All human arts base
themselves ultimately upon the human
hand; and our nearest relatives, the anthropoid
apes, approach humanity to
some extent by reason of their ever-active
and busy little fingers. The elephant,
again, has his flexible trunk, which, as
we have all heard over and over again, is
equally well adapted to pick up a pin or
to break the great boughs of tropical forest
trees. The squirrel, also, remarkable
for his unusual intelligence when judged
by a rodent standard, uses his little paws
as hands by which he can grasp a nut or
fruit all round, and so gain in his small
mind a clear conception of its true shape
and properties. Throughout the animal
kingdom generally, indeed, this chain of
causation makes itself everywhere felt;
no high intelligence without a highly-developed
prehensile and grasping organ.</p>
<p>Perhaps the opossum is the best and
most crucial instance that can be found
of the intimate connection which exists
between touch and intellect. The opossum
is a marsupial; it belongs to the same
group of lowly-organized, antiquated and
pouch-bearing animals as the kangaroo,
the wombat, and other Australian mammals.
Everybody knows that the marsupials,
as a class, are preternaturally
dull&mdash;are perhaps the least intelligent of
all existing quadrupeds. And this is
reasonable when one considers the subject,
for they represent a very early type,
the first &ldquo;rough sketch&rdquo; of the mammalian
idea, with brains unsharpened as
yet by contact with the world in the fierce
competition of the struggle for life as it
displays itself on the crowded stage of the
great continents. They stand, in fact,
to the lions and tigers, the elephants and
horses, the monkeys and squirrels of
America and Europe, as the native Australian
stands to the American or the
Englishman. They are the last relic of
the original secondary quadrupeds,
stranded for centuries on a Southern
island, and still keeping up among Australian
forests the antique type of life that
went out of fashion elsewhere a vast number
of years ago. Hence they have brains
of poor quality, a fact amply demonstrated
by the kangaroo when one
watches his behavior in the zoological
gardens.</p>

<p>Every high-school graduate is well
aware that the opossum, though it is a
marsupial, differs in psychological development
from the kangaroo and the wombat.
The opossum is active and highly
intelligent. He knows his way about the
world in which he lives. &ldquo;A &rsquo;possum up a
gum tree&rdquo; is accepted by observant
minds as the very incarnation of animal
cunning and duplicity. In negro folklore
the resourceful &rsquo;possum takes the
place of the fox in European stories; he
is the Macchiavelli of wild beasts; there
is no ruse on earth of which he is not
amply capable; and no wily manoeuvre
exists which he cannot carry to an end
successfully. All guile and intrigue, the
possum can circumvent even Uncle
Remus himself by his crafty diplomacy.
And what is it that makes all the difference
between this &rsquo;cute marsupial and his
backward Australian cousins? It is the
possession of a prehensile hand and tail.
Therein lies the whole secret. The opossum&rsquo;s
hind foot has a genuine apposable
thumb; and he also uses his tail in climbing
as a supernumerary hand, almost as
much as do any of the monkeys. He
often suspends himself by it, like an acrobat,
swings his body to and fro to obtain
speed, then lets go suddenly, and
flies away to a distant branch, which he
clutches by means of his hand-like hind
foot. If the toes make a mistake, he can
recover his position by the use of his prehensile
tail. The result is that the opossum,
being able to form for himself clear
and accurate conceptions of the real
shapes and relations of things by these
two distinct grasping organs, has acquired
an unusual amount of general intelligence.
And further, in the keen competition
for life, he has been forced to develop
an amount of cunning which leaves
his Australian poor relations far behind
in the Middle Ages of psychological evolution.</p>
<p>At the risk of appearing to forsake my
ostensible subject altogether, I must
pause for a moment to answer a very obvious
objection to my argument. How
about the dog and the horse? They have
no prehensile organ, and yet they are admitted
to be the most intelligent of all
quadrupeds. The cleverness of the horse
and the dog, however, is acquired, not
original. It has arisen in the course of
long and hereditary association with man,
the cleverest and most serviceable individuals
having been deliberately selected
from generation to generation as dams
and sires to breed from. We cannot fairly
compare these artificial human products
with wild races whose intelligence is
entirely self-evolved. In addition, the
horse has, to a slight extent, a prehensile
organ in his mobile and sensitive lip,
which he uses like an undeveloped or rudimentary
proboscis with which he can
feel things all over. We may conclude,
I believe, that touch is &ldquo;the mother-tongue
of the senses;&rdquo; and that in proportion
as animals have or have not
highly developed and serviceable tactile
organs will they rank high or low in the
intellectual hierarchy of nature. It may
well be asked how all this concerns the
family of parrots. In the first place, anybody
who has ever kept a parrot or a
macaw in slavery is well aware that in no
other birds do the claws so closely resemble
a human or simian hand, not indeed
in outer form or appearance, but in apposability
of the thumbs and in perfection
of grasping power. The toes upon
each foot are arranged in opposite pairs&mdash;two
turning in front and two backward,
which gives all parrots their peculiar
firmness in clinging on a perch or on the
branch of a tree with one foot only, while
they extend the other to grasp a fruit or
to clutch at any object they desire to possess.
This peculiarity, it must be admitted,
is not confined to the parrots, for they
share the division of the foot into two
thumbs and two fingers with a large
group of allied birds, called, in the exact
language of technical ornithology,
the Scansorial Picarians, and more generally
known by their several names of
cockatoos, toucans and wood-peckers.
All the members of this great group, of
which the parrots proper are only the
most advanced and developed family,
possess the same arrangement of the
digits into front-toes and back-toes, and
in none is the power of grasping an object
all round so completely developed and
so full of intellectual consequences.</p>
<p>All the Scansorial Picarians are essentially
tree-haunters; and the tree-haunting
and climbing habit seems specially
favorable to the growth of intellect.
Monkeys, squirrels, opossums, wild cats,
are all of them climbers, and all of them,
in the act of climbing, jumping, and balancing
themselves on boughs, gain such
an accurate idea of geometrical figures,
distance, perspective and the true nature
of space-relations, as could hardly be acquired
in any other way. In a few words,
they thoroughly understand the tactual
realities that answer to and underlie each
visible appearance. This is, in my opinion,
one of the substrata of all intelligence;
and the monkeys, possessing it
more profoundly than any other animals,
except man, have accordingly reached a
very high place in the competitive examination
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
perpetually taking place under
the name of Natural Selection.</p>
<p>So, too, among birds, the parrots and
their allies climb trees and rocks with
exceptional ease and agility. Even in
their own department they are the great
feathered acrobats. Anybody who watches
a wood-pecker, for example, grasping the
bark of a tree with its crooked and powerful
toes, while it steadies itself behind
by digging its stiff tail-feathers into the
crannies of the outer rind, will readily
understand how clear a notion the bird
must gain into the practical action of the
laws of gravity. But the true parrots go
a step further in the same direction than
the wood-peckers or the toucans; for in
addition to prehensile feet, they have also
a highly-developed prehensile bill, and
within it a tongue which acts in reality as
an organ of touch. They use their
crooked beaks to help them in climbing
from branch to branch; and being thus
provided alike with wings, hands, fingers,
bill and tongue, they are the most truly
arboreal of all known animals, and present
in the fullest and highest degree all
the peculiar features of the tree-haunting
existence.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. Alone among birds or
mammals, the parrots have the curious
peculiarity of being able to move the upper
as well as the lower jaw. It is this
strange mobility of both the mandibles
together, combined with the crafty effect
of the sideways glance from those artful
eyes, that gives the characteristic air of
intelligence and wisdom to the parrot&rsquo;s
face. We naturally expect so clever a
bird to speak. And when it turns upon
us suddenly with some well-known
maxim, we are not astonished at its remarkable
intelligence.</p>
<p>Parrots are true vegetarians; with a
single degraded exception, to which I
shall recur hereafter, they do not touch
animal food. They live chiefly upon a
diet of fruit and seeds, or upon the abundant
nectar of rich tropical flowers. And
it is mainly for the purpose of getting at
their chosen food that they have developed
the large and powerful bills which
characterize the family. Most of us have
probably noticed that many tropical fruit-eaters,
like the hornbills and the toucans,
are remarkable for the size and strength of
their beaks; and the majority of thinking
people are well acquainted with the fact
that tropical fruits often have thick or
hard or bitter rinds, which must be torn
off before the monkeys or birds, for whose
use they are intended, can get at them
and eat them.</p>
<p>As monkeys use their fingers in place
of knives and forks, so birds use their
sharp and powerful bills. No better nut-crackers
and fruit-parers could possibly
be found. The parrot, in particular, has
developed for the purpose his curved and
inflated beak&mdash;a wonderful weapon, keen
as a tailor&rsquo;s scissors, and moved by powerful
muscles on both sides of the face
which bring together the cutting edges
with extraordinary energy. The way the
bird holds a fruit gingerly in one claw,
while he strips off the rind dexterously
with his under-hung lower mandible, and
keeps a sharp look-out meanwhile for a
possible intruder, suggests to the observing
mind the whole living drama of his
native forest. One sees in that vivid
world the watchful monkey ever ready to
swoop down upon the tempting tail-feathers
of his hereditary foe; one sees
the parrot ever prepared for his rapid attack,
and eager to make him pay with
five joints of his tail for his impertinent
interference with an unoffending fellow-citizen
of the arboreal community.</p>
<p>Of course there are parrots and parrots.
The great black cockatoo, for example,
the largest of the tribe, lives almost
exclusively upon the central shoot
of palm-trees; an expensive kind of food,
for when once this so-called &ldquo;cabbage&rdquo;
has been eaten the tree dies, so that each
black cockatoo must have killed in his
time whole groves of cabbage-palms.
Other parrots live on fruits and seeds;
and quite a number are adapted for
flower-haunting and honey-sucking.</p>
<p>As a group, the parrots must be comparatively
modern birds. Indeed, they
could have no place in the world till the
big tropical fruits and nuts were beginning
to be developed. And it is now generally
believed that fruits and nuts are
for the most part of recent and special
evolution. To put the facts briefly, the
monkeys and parrots developed the
fruits and nuts, while the fruits and nuts
returned the compliment by developing
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
conversely the monkeys and parrots. In
other words, both types grew up side by
side in mutual dependence, and evolved
themselves pari passu for one another&rsquo;s
benefit. Without the fruits there could
be no fruit-eaters; and without the fruit-eaters
to disperse their seeds, there could
not be any great number of fruits.</p>
<p>Most of the parrots very much resemble
the monkeys and other tropical fruit-eaters
in their habits and manners. They
are gregarious, mischievous and noisy.
They have no moral sense, and are fond
of practical jokes. They move about in
flocks, screeching aloud as they go, and
alight together on some tree well covered
with berries. No doubt they herd together
for the sake of protection, and
screech both to keep the flock in a body
and to strike consternation into the
breasts of their enemies. When danger
threatens, the first bird that perceives it
sounds a note of warning; and in a moment
the whole troupe is on the wing at
once, vociferous and eager, roaring forth
a song in their own tongue, which may
be interpreted to mean that they are
ready to fight if it is necessary.</p>
<p>The common gray parrot, the best
known in confinement of all his kind, and
unrivalled as an orator for his graces of
speech, is a native of West Africa. He
feeds in a general way upon palm-nuts,
bananas, mangoes, and guavas, but he is
by no means averse, if opportunity offers,
to the Indian corn of the industrious native.
It is only in confinement that this
bird&rsquo;s finer qualities come out, and that it
develops into a speechmaker of distinguished
attainments.</p>
<p>A peculiar and exceptional offshoot of
the parrot group is the brush-tongued
lory, several species of which are common
in Australia and India. These interesting
birds are parrots which have a
resemblance to humming birds. Flitting
about from tree to tree with great rapidity,
they thrust their long extensible
tongues, penciled with honey-gathering
hairs, into the tubes of many big tropical
blossoms. The lories, indeed, live entirely
on nectar, and they are so common in
the region they have made their own that
the larger flowers there present the appearance
of having been developed with
a special view to their tastes and habits,
as well as to the structure of their peculiar
brush-like honey-collector. In most parrots
the mouth is dry and the tongue
horny; but in the lories it is moist and
much more like the same organ in the
humming-birds and the sun-birds. The
prevalence of very large and brilliantly-colored
flowers in the Malayan region
must be set down for the most part to
the selective action of the color-loving,
brush-tongued parrots.</p>
<p>The Australian continent and New
Zealand, as everybody knows, are the
countries where everything goes by contraries.
And it is here that the parrot
group has developed some of its most
curious offshoots. One would imagine
beforehand that no two birds could be
more unlike in every respect than the
gaudy, noisy, gregarious cockatoos and
the sombre, nocturnal, solitary owls. Yet
the New Zealand owl-parrot is a lory
which has assumed all the appearances
and habits of an owl. A lurker in the twilight
or under the shades of night, burrowing
for its nest in holes in the ground,
it has dingy brown plumage like the owls,
with an undertone of green to bespeak its
parrot origin; while its face is entirely
made up of two great disks, surrounding
the eyes, which succeed in giving it a
most marked and unmistakable owl-like
appearance.</p>
<p>Why should a parrot so strangely disguise
itself and belie its ancestry? The
reason is not difficult to discover. It
found a place for itself ready made in nature.
New Zealand is a remote and
sparsely-stocked island, peopled by various
forms of life from adjacent but still
distant continents. There are no dangerous
enemies there. Here, then, was a
great opportunity for a nightly prowler.
The owl-parrot, with true business instinct,
saw the opening thus clearly laid
before it, and took to a nocturnal and
burrowing life, with the natural consequence
that those forms survived which
were dingy in color. Unlike the owls,
however, the owl-parrot, true to the vegetarian
instincts of the whole lory race,
lives almost entirely upon sprigs of
mosses and other creeping plants. It is
thus essentially a ground bird; and as it
feeds at night in a country possessing no
native beasts of prey, it has almost lost
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
the power of flight, and uses its wings
only as a sort of parachute to break its
fall in descending from a rock or a tree
to its accustomed feeding-ground. To
ascend a steep place or a tree, it climbs,
parrot-like, with its hooked claws, up the
surface of the trunk or the face of the
precipice.</p>
<p>Even more aberrant in its ways, however,
than the burrowing owl-parrot, is
that other strange and hated New Zealand
lory, the kea, which, alone among
its kind, has adjured the gentle ancestral
vegetarianism of the cockatoos and
macaws, in favor of a carnivorous diet of
remarkable ferocity. And what is
stranger still, this evil habit has been developed
in the kea since the colonization
of New Zealand by the British, the most
demoralizing of new-comers, as far as
all aborigines are concerned. The English
settlers have taught the Maori to
wear silk hats and to drink strong liquors,
and they have thrown temptation in the
way of even the once innocent native parrot.
Before the white man came, the kea
was a mild-mannered, fruit-eating or
honey-sucking bird. But as soon as
sheep-stations were established on the
island these degenerate parrots began to
acquire a distinct taste for raw mutton.
At first they ate only the offal that was
thrown out from the slaughter-houses,
picking the bones as clean of meat as a
dog or a jackal. But in course of time,
as the taste for blood grew, a new and
debased idea entered their heads. If
dead sheep are good to eat, are not living
ones? The keas, having pondered deeply
over this abstruse problem, solved it in
the affirmative. Proceeding to act upon
their convictions, they invented a truly
hideous mode of procedure. A number
of birds hunt out a weakly member of a
flock, almost always after dark. The
sheep is worried to death by the combined
efforts of the parrots, some of whom
perch themselves upon the animal&rsquo;s back
and tear open the flesh, their object being
to reach the kidneys, which they devour
at the earliest possible moment. As many
as two hundred ewes are said to have been
killed in a single night on one &ldquo;station&rdquo;&mdash;ranch,
we should call it. I need hardly
say that the New Zealand sheep-farmer
resents this irregular procedure, so opposed
to all ideas of humanity, to say
nothing of good-farming, and, as a result,
the existence of the kea is now limited
to a few years. But from a purely
psychological point of view the case is interesting,
as being the best recorded instance
of the growth of a new and complex
instinct actually under the eyes of
human observers.</p>
<p>A few words as to the general coloring
of the parrot group. Tropical forestine
birds have usually a ground tone of green
because that color enables them best to
escape notice among the monotonous
verdure of equatorial woodland scenery.
In the north, it is true, green is a very
conspicuous color; but that is only because
for half the year our trees are bare,
and even during the other half they lack
that &ldquo;breadth of tropic shade&rdquo; which
characterizes the forests of all hot countries.
Therefore, in temperate climates,
the common ground-tone of birds is
brown, to harmonize with the bare
boughs and leafless twigs, the dead grass
or stubble. But in the ever-green tropics,
green is the proper hue for concealment
or defense. Therefore the parrots, the
most purely tropical family of birds on
earth, are chiefly greenish; and among
the smaller and more defenceless sorts,
like the little love-birds, where the need
for protection is greatest, the green of
the plumage is almost unbroken. Green,
in truth, must be regarded as the basal
parrot tint, from which all other colors
are special decorative variations.</p>
<p>But fruit-eating and flower-feeding
creatures&mdash;such as butterflies and humming
birds&mdash;seeking their food among
the brilliant flowers and bright berries,
almost invariably acquire a taste for varied
coloring, and by the aid of the factor
in evolution, known as sexual selection,
this taste stereotypes itself at last
upon their wings and plumage. They
choose their mates for their attractive
coloring. As a consequence, all the
larger and more gregarious parrots, in
which the need for concealment is less,
tend to diversify the fundamental green
of their coats with red, yellow or blue,
which in some cases takes possession of
the entire body. The largest kinds of all,
like the great blue and yellow or crimson
macaws, are as gorgeous as birds well
could be; they are also the species least
afraid of enemies. In Brazil, it is said,
they may often be seen moving about in
pairs in the evening with as little attempt
at concealment as storks in Germany.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Even the New Zealand owl-parrot still
retains many traces of his original greenness,
mixed with the brown and dingy
yellow of his nocturnal and burrowing
nature.</p>
<p>I now turn to the parrot&rsquo;s power of
mimicry in human language. This power
is only an incidental result of the general
intelligence of parrots, combined with the
other peculiarities of their social life and
forestine character. Dominant woodland
animals, like monkeys and parrots,
at least if vegetarian in their habits, are
almost always gregarious, noisy, mischievous,
and imitative. And the imitation
results directly from a somewhat
high order of intelligence. The power
of intellect, in all except the very highest
phases, is merely the ability to accurately
imitate another. Monkeys imitate action
to a great extent, but their voices are
hardly flexible enough for very much
mimicry of the human voice. Parrots
and some other birds, on the contrary,
like the mocking bird, being endowed
with considerable flexibility of voice, imitate
either songs or spoken words with
great distinctness. In the parrot the
power of attention is also very considerable,
for the bird will often repeat to itself
the lesson it has decided to learn. But
most of us forget that at best the parrot
knows only the general application of a
sentence, not the separate meanings of its
component words. It knows, for example,
that &ldquo;Polly wants a lump of sugar&rdquo;
is a phrase often followed by a gift of
food. But to believe it can understand
an exclamation like &ldquo;What a homely lot
of parrots!&rdquo; is to credit the bird with
genuine comprehension. A careful consideration
of the evidence has convinced
almost all scientific men that, at the most,
a parrot knows the meaning of a sentence
in the same way as a dog understands the
meaning of &ldquo;Rats&rdquo; or a horse knows the
significance of &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4">POLLY.</h2>
<p>Letty was out under the big elm tree
watching the kitten playing with the autumn
leaves that were on the ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly something struck Letty on
the shoulder. She looked around quickly,
thinking that somebody had thrown a
stone at her. No one was in sight,
though she looked all about and even up
in the tree. Then she noticed that the
kitten was rolling something with its
paws. She stooped and picked up what
looked like a little bunch of elm leaves.
She thought it strange that they should
be stuck together, and when she found
that it was quite heavy she was still more
surprised.</p>
<p>She carried it into the house to show
to her mother. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;It came down off the tree and hit me
on my shoulder. Is there a stone inside
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;It is a chrysalis.
Some worm that lived on the elm
tree drew these leaves together and spun
a little case inside, and when the leaves
were ready to fall, the chrysalis came
down with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a worm do you suppose
it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but it must have been
a large one, or the chrysalis would not be
so heavy. We will keep it, and in the
spring when the worm has turned into a
butterfly and comes out of the case, perhaps
we can learn what its name is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will it get out?&rdquo; asked Letty,
anxiously. &ldquo;It is so hard and tough. I
tried to pull off one of the leaves and it
stuck on tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;it is very
tough and you could not tear it open
with your fingers even if you tried very
hard. But the butterfly throws out some
kind of fluid which softens the silk&mdash;for
it is a kind of silk, you know&mdash;and makes
a hole large enough to crawl through. It
does not have to be very big, as the butterfly&rsquo;s
wings are soft and wet. It has
to let them dry and grow strong and stiff
before it can fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chrysalis was put in a safe place
and Letty forgot all about it for many
months, which was not strange when
there were so many things for her to do
all through the winter and early spring.</p>
<p>But her mother did not forget, and one
day in June she called Letty in from her
play telling her that she had something
to show her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the elm chrysalis?&rdquo;
she asked, and she put it in Letty&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why how light it is!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The
butterfly has come out, oh! where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother led the way to the plant
stand. &ldquo;See, on that begonia,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; cried Letty, &ldquo;what a beautiful
butterfly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very large, nearly five inches
across when its wings were spread. It
was dull yellow, with darker shadings, a
little red in waving lines, and a gray
stripe along the front edge of its outer
wings. It was quite furry, especially the
large yellow body. Each of the four
wings had a transparent eye spot, and
the under wings had a good deal of black
about these little round windows, as Letty
called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, mamma, see! It has beautiful
little dark-blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has, but I did not notice them
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what kind of a butterfly is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a butterfly at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a butterfly?&rdquo; said Letty, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it is a moth. Have you noticed
its antennae&mdash;the horns on the front of
its head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look like feathers,&rdquo; said Letty;
&ldquo;no, like ferns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they do,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;Well,
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
that is how we know it is not a butterfly,
for they have thread-like antennae, with a
little knob on the end. Moths fly by
night and that is probably why this one
stays so still now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew its name,&rdquo; said Letty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will take my card and run over
to the public library and ask the librarian
to give you a book that tells about moths
and butterflies, we will find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letty came back in a little while with
the book and her mother began to look
in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said pretty soon, &ldquo;it has
such a long name that I don&rsquo;t believe
you can remember it. It is Telea polyphemus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call it Polly for short,&rdquo; said Letty.</p>
<p>When they had learned all they could
about the moth Letty asked what they
should do with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This book says they do no very great
harm,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;and it is so
beautiful that I think we will let it have
its liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Telea polyphemus was carried
out and placed on a tree trunk where it
stayed all the rest of the day. But the
next morning when Letty went to look
for it, it was gone.</p>

<h2 id="c6">THE AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Pelecanus erythrorhynchos.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>In the year 1758 the naturalist Linnaeus
gave to the birds called Pelicans the
generic name Pelecanus. In this genus
he also placed the cormorants and the
gannets. These with the snake-birds,
the frigate-birds and the tropic-birds were
for a long time grouped together under
the family name Pelecanidae. This name,
however, is now restricted to the various
species of the Pelicans which are included
in a single genus.</p>
<p>The generic name Pelecanus and the
common name Pelican are derived from
pelekan, the Greek name for these birds.
They were well known to the ancients by
whom they were called Ornacrotalus.
There is a legend of great antiquity for
which there is no foundation in fact, which
states that the pelican feeds to her young
blood drawn from her own breast, in
which she herself has made the incision.</p>
<p>There are about ten species of pelicans
distributed throughout the world, mostly
confined to those countries having warm
climates. Two or three species, however,
extend their range into the colder regions
during the summer months. Three
of the species inhabit North America and
two of these are seldom seen except on
the sea coasts; the brown pelican (Pelecanus
fuscus) on the Atlantic coast and
the California brown pelican (Pelecanus
californicus) on the Pacific coast. The
other species is the bird of our illustration,
and is common in the interior as
well as on the seaboard of California.</p>
<p>The pelicans are notably social in their
habits, a large number nesting together.
The flight of a large flock is an attractive
sight. Their wings move in unison and
apparently without much effort. After a
few strokes of the wings they frequently
sail, forming graceful circles, often at
great elevations.</p>
<p>The most remarkable characteristic of
these birds, however, is the large pouch
formed by an elastic skin depending from
the two sides of the lower mandible and
extending nearly the whole length of the
bill. This pouch may be greatly distended
and will hold a large quantity of either
solid or liquid matter. The bills are depressed
and strongly hooked.</p>
<p>The American White Pelican ranges
throughout the whole of North America
as far north, in the interior, as the 61&deg;
north latitude, and as far to the southward
in winter as Central America.
Northward from Florida, along the Atlantic
coast, it is now rare.</p>
<p>In the year 1838 Audubon gave this
species the specific name Americanus, in
view of his discovery that it differed in
essential characteristics from the European
form, called Ornacrotalus. The most
marked difference that he noticed was the
crest upon the upper mandible which he
supposed was permanent and not, as we
now know, a characteristic of this species
only during the breeding season. In writing
of the naming of this species he uses
the following beautiful language: &ldquo;In
consequence of this discovery, I have
honored it with the name of my beloved
country, over the mighty streams of
which may this splendid bird wander free
and unmolested to the most distant times,
as it has already done in the misty ages of
unknown antiquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much as we desire to honor Audubon,
who has given us so much of interest concerning
the life histories of the birds, yet
we are restrained by the rules of scientific
naming, which require under ordinary
circumstances, the use of the earliest
name. Audubon&rsquo;s name was antedated
by that of Gmelin, a German Naturalist,
who in 1788 noticing the peculiar characteristics
of the American White Pelican
and that it differed from the European
form, gave it the name erythrorhynchos,
which is now used by ornithologists. This
name has its origin in two Greek words,
meaning red and bill.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The peculiar growth or crest on the bill
which disappears soon after the breeding
season, varies greatly both in size and
shape. Dr. Ridgway says: &ldquo;Frequently
it consists of a single piece, nearly as high
as long, its vertical outlines almost parallel,
and the upper outline quite regularly
convex, the largest specimen seen being
about three inches high, by as many
in length. More frequently, however, it
is very irregular in shape, usually less elevated,
and not infrequently with ragged
anterior, or even posterior continuations.&rdquo;
At this time the bill is also more or less
orange-red in color.</p>
<p>An excellent narrative of the habits of
the White Pelican is given in the Ornithology
of Illinois, where Dr. Ridgway
quotes the words of Col. N. S. Goss regarding
those who &ldquo;have not seen the
White Pelicans upon their feeding
grounds, but may have read Audubon&rsquo;s
interesting description of the manner
in which the birds unite and drive the
fishes into shallow water, where they can
catch them, which they cannot well do in
deep water, as their skins are honey-combed
with air cells that buoy them up
like cork, and prevent their diving, and
they do not plunge for their food when
upon the wing, like their cousins, the
Brown Pelicans, and therefore have to
adopt fishing habits suited to shallow
waters. I have often noticed the birds in
flocks, in pairs, or alone, swimming on the
water with partially opened wings, and
head drawn down and back, the bill just
clearing the water, ready to strike and
gobble up the prey within their reach;
when so fishing, if they ran into a shoal of
minnows, they would stretch out their
necks, drop their heads upon the water,
and with open mouths and extended
pouches, scoop up the tiny fry. Their favorite
time for fishing on the seashore is
during the incoming tide, as with it come
the small fishes to feed upon the insects
caught in the rise, and upon the low
form of life in the drift, as it washes shoreward,
the larger fishes following in their
wake, each, from the smallest to the largest,
eagerly engaged in taking life in order
to sustain life. All sea-birds know this,
and the time of its coming well. The
White Pelicans, that have been patiently
waiting in line along the beach, quietly
move into the water and glide smoothly
out so as not to frighten the life beneath.
At a suitable distance from the shore they
form into line in accordance with the sinuosities
of the beach, each facing shoreward
and awaiting their leader&rsquo;s signal to
start. When this is given, all is commotion;
the birds, rapidly striking the water
with their wings, throwing it high above
them and plunging their heads in and out,
fairly make the water foam as they move
in an almost unbroken line, filling their
pouches as they go. When satisfied with
their catch, they wade and waddle into
line again upon the beach, where they remain
to rest, standing or sitting as suits
them best, until they have leisurely swallowed
the fishes in their nets; then, if undisturbed,
they generally rise in a flock
and circle for a long time high in air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White Pelicans will consume a
large amount of food; in fact, they are
gluttonous. It is said that the remains of
several hundred minnows have been taken
from the stomach of a single pelican.
Usually they are the most active in the
pursuit of their prey for a short time after
sunrise and also before sunset.</p>
<p>The chief breeding grounds of the
White Pelican are from Minnesota northwards
to the limit of its range. It nests
also in isolated and greatly separated
localities to the westward. It is said that
several thousand permanently breed on
the islands of the great Salt Lake. There
are reasons for believing that it also
breeds in Florida and westward along
the Gulf of Mexico as far as Texas.</p>
<p>The White Pelican builds its nest on
the ground using small sticks and twigs.
They usually select a clump of sage or
some other plant that will afford the nest
some protection. Frequently sand is
heaped around the nest to the depth of
about six inches. The nests are about one
foot in diameter. The color of the two to
four eggs is a chalky white and the surface
is quite rough, due to the irregular
thickness of the outer coating. The average
size of the eggs is about three and
one-half by two and one-third inches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The White Pelican as it calmly floats
on the surface of the water, some distance
from the shore, has been mistaken for the
sail of a boat as the moist white feathers
glisten in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Longfellow has beautifully woven this
fact into the &ldquo;Song of Hiawatha.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c8">A BIT OF BIRD GOSSIP.</h2>
<p>The sun shone brightly through the
green leaves of the trees and crowned
each tiny ripple on the lake with a glistening
diamond. A Robin Redbreast
hopped along the shore, picking up a few
pebbles, for the poor thing has to wear
her false teeth in her stomach, as it were,
having no teeth in her head with which to
chew her food.</p>
<p>There was a rush of wings above her
and she dropped the grain of sand with
which she had thought to fill up her gizzard,
cocked her smooth black head on
one side and watched the approach of another
bird. Was it friend or enemy? It
proved to belong to the aristocratic family
of Thrushes&mdash;real high-flyers among
birds&mdash;who alighted on the same sandy
shore and advanced &ldquo;with many a flirt
and flutter&rdquo; to greet her old friend, for
they had been neighbors in the same
sunny orchard the year before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So glad to meet you again, Mrs. Redbreast,&rdquo;
said the gracious Thrush in a
most musical voice, &ldquo;but are you not a
long way from the willows on the river
bank where I last had the pleasure of seeing
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we never finished that house
among the willows. We became dissatisfied
with the neighborhood,&rdquo; answered
Mrs. Redbreast, after performing the
graceful courtesy of a well-bred bird, as
are all Robin Redbreasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I was afraid of malaria when we
looked the ground over together in the
spring. It was too low, almost swampy.
Mr. Thrush and I went to a little knoll
about three miles away and built in the
loveliest, the most fragrant wild crabapple
tree you ever saw,&rdquo; and Mrs. Thrush
smoothed with shining beak a mottled
feather on her handsome breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would not those lovely blossoms
tempt those creatures&mdash;boys, I think they
are called&mdash;to climb until they found
your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thorns stand sentinel and the
thick leaves hide it well, and I wanted my
children to grow up strong, and swift on
the wing. They would never grow up
well feathered and beautiful amid those
lovely willows on account of the low
ground,&rdquo; replied the Thrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not malaria that caused us to
abandon our half-built nest, but boys,
some black as crows and some white as
doves, kept coming to get materials for
whistles. It seems that the very tree we
chose had bark that slipped the easiest,
and sometimes a flock of three or four
would be perched on the limbs (they always
sit astride, so awkwardly, you
know), with jack-knives in their hands,
and of course we could not stay. Robin
wanted to come to the park&mdash;it is a lovely
place&mdash;where those fine big creatures with
bright stars on their gray coats are put to
take care of us birds. Why,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;they will not let boys stone even an
English Sparrow, but I think that is altogether
too particular. There comes a
party of the little cockneys now,&rdquo; as a
handful of winged brown balls came fluttering
through the air close to the heads
of the larger birds, who could easily have
put them to flight if they would but try.
However, they ducked their heads and
scampered into the weeds, leaving the
smooth shore to the new-comers, who
dipped and splashed in the shallow edge
of the lake as if they enjoyed it mightily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just see the horrid little things washing
themselves in water, but they never
can get clean. Why, my Robin, who is
a very venturesome fellow and sometimes
follows the boulevards almost into the
heart of the city, says that he has seen
them in the dirty city streets washing
themselves in the dust like common barnyard
fowls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s look at them,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Thrush. &ldquo;They are doing it just
because it looks respectable, and they
know that we wash in water;&rdquo; and the
two birds spread their wings and swept
disdainfully away from the neighborhood
of the Sparrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you finally build, Mrs.
Redbreast?&rdquo; asked the other as they settled
gracefully on the shore a half a mile
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Robin, as I said, wanted very
much to live in the park. He is so fond
of company, but I told him there were too
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
many children on the grass. Why, they
are as thick as dandelions any fine day,
and in spite of the care of the great gray
creatures it would be impossible to safely
teach our children to fly. We finally
found a lovely suburban place within
easy flying distance of the park. An
apple tree with perfect branches for a
nest grew in the back yard, the cherry
trees were white with bloom and the
whole place fragrant with the blossoms
of the grape. There was a flat jar always
kept filled with water for the birds, with
a stone in it that reached nearly to the
surface on which to stand while bathing.
The water made the birds come in flocks,
so that the place was gay with songs, and
really that yard was a little Eden. But
you know,&rdquo; she went on, dropping her
voice, &ldquo;there is a story of something terrible
that walked in the garden of Eden,
and I think it was a black cat, for that
is what walks in our garden. He lies on
the back steps in the sunshine pretending
to be asleep, but where his eyes ought to
be in that big black ball he calls his head
I can see a narrow yellow stripe, and out
of that stripe of yellow he watches every
bird that comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he get any birds?&rdquo; asked the
Thrush in an awe-struck whisper.</p>
<p>The Redbreast shook her black head
sadly. &ldquo;Every now and then his mistress
finds him with feathers in his whiskers,
and she scolds him. But there is a
serpent in every Eden,&rdquo; she added philosophically;
&ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t cats it&rsquo;s boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear what became of the
family of Wrens that lived in the honeysuckle
over the back door?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Thrush, who cared more for gossip than
moralizing. &ldquo;They were so pleasant and
cheery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. We started south before
they left and I haven&rsquo;t seen them since.
They were a proud little folk, that made
believe they were not proud, always wearing
the finest clothes, yet in such sober
colors. I always called them stuck up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their tails certainly were&mdash;he, he, he,&rdquo;
giggled Mrs. Thrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Redbreast.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty good. I must tell that to
Robin. But don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;the Blue Jays that lived in the
elm tree down the lane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought them very well-bred,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Thrush, bridling prettily,
for she and her family pride themselves
on their correct behavior. &ldquo;Wonderfully
pretty, but too loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether too gay and noisy. Mrs.
Jay was a great scold, and Blue almost
as bad. You could hear them all over the
neighborhood. Well, they lost all their
children by a Hawk, though Mrs. Jay
fought bravely for her little ones, and
Blue proved himself a real hero. She
over-exerted herself, however, and died
shortly after of nervous prostration. I
saw a girl, who had found her body,
spreading out her poor dead wings and
holding them up against her hat. She
finally wrapped Mrs. Jay up in her handkerchief
and carried her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If women would only be satisfied with
the wings of a bird that had died a natural
death we would not complain,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Thrush, as she folded her own pretty
wings a little closer. &ldquo;Blue Jay married
again right away, of course,&rdquo; she went
on, as she dropped a little red ant down
among the mill stones of her gizzard to
be ground up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not even wait the conventional
two weeks. If I thought Robin Redbreast
would be looking out for another
housekeeper so soon after my death he
would not have such a good wife as he
has to-day. He would have to hunt more
worms and bugs than he does, instead of
just bringing home a little bit of dessert
in the shape of cherries or grapes to
please the children;&rdquo; and the mother
fluffed up her feathers alarmingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes me think,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Thrush, &ldquo;that I promised the children an
especially nice supper to-night if they
would not chirp or stick up their heads
and look over the edge of the nest. They
are really getting so big now that Mr.
Thrush and I can do nothing with them.
Last night when I went home I found
my eldest son, Brown Thrush, sitting on
the edge of the nest, and he is taller&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a large shadow wavered over
the sunshiny sward, and with a scared exclamation
of &ldquo;Hawk!&rdquo; the birds flew
swiftly in different directions, not waiting
to see that the object which cast the
shadow was nothing but a harmless paper
kite.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE MARBLED MURRELET.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Brachyramphus marmoratus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>This little bird belongs to the family of
auks and puffins, the guillemots and the
dovekie. It is the sea bird family
(Alcidae) for all the species are
maritime, spending most of their time on
the ocean. Nearly all the species frequent
the Pacific coast of North America.
A few are, however, found on the Atlantic
coast. They seem to frequent the
wildest and most rocky shores and generally
congregate in large colonies which
may include several species. Their structure
unfits them for locomotion on the
land where they move in an uncouth and
awkward manner, but they are agile and
quick swimmers and expert divers. It is
said that they will remain under water for
several minutes, swimming for long distances.
They use their wings in diving.
The Marbled Murrelet inhabits the coast
of the Pacific ocean from San Diego, California,
northward, breeding only in the
northern part of its range. These birds
are seldom found at any great distance
inland. It is said that their nests, like
those of the petrels, are built in holes in
banks or in burrows in the ground. They
have also been known to lay their eggs
in the open crevices of cliffs where but
little effort is made to build a nest other
than the gathering together of a few
sticks and twigs.</p>
<p>The ovate eggs are of a buffy color and
are marked with varying shades of
brown.</p>

<h2 id="c11">BOY-CHICKADEE.</h2>
<p>I doubt if any one was ever haunted by
a more commonplace object than a fence-post;
yet, terminating a fence that borders
a little farm, there is a gray old post
which has haunted my imagination for
several years. The fence has long ceased
to fence anything in or out; the uppermost
rail is the only one left and that is
fastened to my post about five inches from
the top. Just under the lee of that rail is
a round hole which is rather jagged about
the lower edge as if gnawed by sharp little
teeth. Every time I travel that road
I am impelled to stop and put a finger
into that hole. I always expect to discover
a secret, yet never do. Still, the
post haunts me for once Boy-Chickadee
kept house there.</p>
<p>Boy-Chickadee is one of our smallest
birds. He wears a dumpy little gray coat
surmounted by a pair of bright black
eyes under a velvety black cap. Dear to
the heart of every bird-lover, he is especially
so in winter. It is then that his
crystal pendulum of song swings lightly
to and fro where other bird-song is rare.
It is rather plaintive&mdash;two minor notes
swing to the left, then two more to the
right&mdash;and seems to belong only to frosty
mornings. Boy-Chickadee stays to wish
you &ldquo;A Merry Christmas&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Happy
New Year,&rdquo; and comes daily to dine on
sunflower seeds stowed in a large gourd
for him. I should be ashamed to say how
many seeds he consumes at a sitting, or
flitting better describes it. He flits in
for a seed, then out to the apple-tree to
hammer it, uttering gurgles of content
all the while. He spends so much time
eating them that I eye my store anxiously
wondering if it will hold out under
such onslaughts. Sometimes he brings
a companion and they take turns going
into the gourd. His British enemies tag
him enviously and hang about the gourd-door;
but it is cut too small for them
and they can only gaze in. It is Boy-Chickadee&rsquo;s
cache.</p>
<p>In summer time Chickadee deserts us
and we must seek him in the fields, and
that is how we came to find the fence-post.
We sat waiting for birds to bathe,
but waited in vain. They bathed up-stream
and they bathed down-stream.
We saw them drying their feathers, but
they would not bathe by us. A dripping
Chickadee flew overhead and sat preening
his feathers in a sweetgum tree. How
nearly we had come to seeing that bath!
(a thing we had never achieved). In despair
we crossed the road and hid behind
the sassafras hedge. Presently something
strange passed us and there was
Dame Chickadee with a very queer burden.
Imagine yourself with a mouthful
of excelsior larger than your head, and
you will have some idea of her comical
appearance. She peered at us from behind
her treasure first with one eye and
then with the other. We were all attention.
A dozen times she darted towards
the old fence, but we were too alarming
and she could not make up her mind to
brave us. Each time she retreated to the
sweetgum, holding tight to her bundle&mdash;it
might have been a clematis blossom, I
could not say. It was the first time I
had ever seen a Chickadee look self-conscious.
At the same time we saw that
Boy-Chickadee had dipped in once more
and was dripping wet. It was maddening.
At last she made a wide curve towards
us and disappeared. I sprang to
the fence-post and discovered the round
hole, and with an ecstatic catch of the
breath I put one finger in. A bunch of
indignant feathers hurled itself against
my hand and out came the finger and out
came she and whisked away with such
lightning rapidity that we barely saw her.
The hole was too deep and too well shadowed
to tell us anything more than that
it had a secret in its keeping and although
we should have liked to camp by
the post it was not to be.</p>
<p>At our next visit we found Dame Chickadee
setting and Boy Chickadee feeding
her; again, and the post had become a
nursery. It seemed too ludicrous that
such babes-in-the-woods should ever attain
to the dignity of fatherhood and
motherhood; but this time neither parent
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
was there to be laughed at, and as I tapped
at the door a perfectly intelligible &ldquo;Day-day-day-day&rdquo;
came from the nursery; the
babes had already learned to talk!</p>
<p>It was so long before we visited them
again that we expected to find the post
deserted. There was no sign of occupancy
and I felt depressed because it was all
over. But a gentle tap brought a tiny,
angular cranium and a careworn baby
face to the door. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible
that Boy Chickadee could have such a
homely bairn! We withdrew in haste
when he threatened to come out; but we
had summoned him and the moment had
come to seek his fortune. The youngster
stepped into the door and set sail
straight across the wide roadway. When
we caught a rear view of the tiny sailboat
our gravity was undone, for not a vestige
of tail adorned it and he was the most unfinished
fledgling we had ever seen.</p>
<p>This was the last sign of life the old
fence-post yielded, but I cannot learn to
believe it final. I am constantly expecting
to see more Chickadees set sail, and
its possibilities still haunt me.</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE STORY BIRD.</h2>
<p>The parrot has been called the &ldquo;bird-man&rdquo;
on account of its intelligence; but
so many anecdotes are told of it that it
might well be styled the Story-bird.</p>
<p>Of the four hundred and thirty different
species known, America claims one
hundred and twenty-six. Europe is the
only large country that does not possess
native tribes of parrots.</p>
<p>The parrot is the monkey of the feathered
world, because of his imitative powers.
He also uses one of his feet as a
hand to carry what he eats to his beak.</p>
<p>A parrot possessed of remarkable linguistic
powers, being able to speak in
Spanish, Portuguese, French, German
and English, was accustomed whenever a
visitor was at all boisterous to imitate his
laugh and then groan in anguish, exclaiming
in tones of commiseration,
&ldquo;Poor, poor Polly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cardinal is said to have paid a hundred
crowns for a parrot that could recite
without a blunder the Apostles&rsquo;
creed and chant the Magnificat correctly.</p>
<p>An attempt was once made to reform a
bad parrot which kept saying, in reference
to his mistress, &ldquo;I wish the old lady
would die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate sent over his own bird, that
had been religiously trained, hoping its
influence would have a good effect on
the bad bird. But whenever the latter
said, &ldquo;I wish the old lady would die,&rdquo; the
clergyman&rsquo;s bird rolled up its eyes and
exclaimed, &ldquo;We beseech Thee to hear
us, good Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13">THE BEAR.</h2>
<p>Though the Bear is classed with the
Carnivora, or flesh-eating animals, it is
really omnivorous in the best acceptance
of that word, for it will thrive on a vegetable
diet for many weeks at a time. Bears
will devour the various kinds of berries,
grains, the succulent leaves of herbs and
the fleshy roots, with evident relish. There
is, perhaps, no more dainty morsel for
them than the young and tender buds of
trees and shrubs as they are prepared by
Nature, wrapped in their winter covering
and containing an abundant food,
stored there for the nourishment of the
growth of the coming season&mdash;a food useful
to the animal as well as the plant. The
young seem to depend entirely on vegetable
food, but as they grow older, though
still preferring the products of the plant,
they will eat a variety of animal forms,
such as insects, mollusks, crustaceans,
worms, birds and their eggs. When
driven by hunger they will kill and eat
larger prey, such as deer and domestic
cattle. They will also devour the dead
bodies of animals freshly killed, but only
before there is any taint or odor. Thus,
though Bears have the structural characteristics
of the flesh-eating animals, this
classification is misleading to the untutored
observer who watches them in our
menageries or even in their native homes.</p>
<p>The Polar Bears are perhaps the most
carnivorous of them all, living almost entirely
on animal food, when in their natural
homes. The Grizzly Bear is also
a flesh-eating species, though it will subsist
on a vegetable diet. It is an interesting
fact that the nature of their food seems
to determine the degree of strength and
the ferocity that they possess. The influence
of the diet is shown not only on
the various species but also upon the individuals
of the same species. The Bears
fed only upon vegetable foods exhibit a
much milder disposition and are less resentful
when crossed.</p>
<p>Bears are distributed throughout the
world except in Australia. In the words
of Brehm, &ldquo;They inhabit the warmest as
well as the coldest of countries, high
mountains as well as the coasts of the
Arctic Sea. Nearly all species select
dense, extensive forests or rocky regions,
generally lonely spots. Some delight in
watery or damp situations, streams, rivers,
lakes, swamps and the sea, while others
prefer stretches of dry land. One species
is confined to the sea-coast and seldom
penetrates the depths of the continent, but
still undertakes more extensive migrations
than the others, traversing great distances
on drift ice, crossing the northern
Arctic Ocean and migrating from one
continent to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the bears of the present day
there are extinct forms, remains of which
occur in the later geologic ages. The
Great Cave Bear, remains of which have
been found in the caves of Central
Europe, indicate that this species was
even larger than our Polar Bear, which
may measure nine feet in length.</p>
<p>The opinion is prevalent that the movements
of the Bear are awkward and slow
and that they are neither fleet nor active
in locomotion. This is true, to a certain
extent, in the case of the larger species,
though they are endowed with great endurance.
On the other hand the smaller
species are notably quick and active in
their motions. In fact all species when
excited will pass over the ground at a
rapid rate, their strides resembling a sort
of gallop. All climb, especially when
young or until their great weight prevents
them from doing so.</p>
<p>A few of the species are excellent swimmers
and can remain under water for
some time. The Polar Bear well illustrates
this characteristic, for it has been
seen many miles from the shore, swimming
easily and showing a wonderful
power of endurance.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>We are told that &ldquo;some species are sensible
and sagacious and may be trained
to a certain extent; but they exhibit no
high mental development. Some individuals
become very tame, though they
display no particular affection for their
master and keeper. They always revert
to their grosser animal instincts in old
age, for then they become wicked, intractable
and violent. The Bears signify
their various moods by modulations of
their remarkable voices, finding utterance
in dull growling, snorting and murmuring,
or grunting, whistling and sometimes
barking sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A family of young Bears consists of
from one to six, which are fed and protected
in the most tender manner by their
watchful and careful mother. Born naked
and blind, it is usually five or six weeks
before they can see and have a seasonable
coat of hair. After this, they are
full of life and very playful, and their
antics are very amusing.</p>
<p>Bears may be classed under three
groups; the Sea Bears, the Land Bears
and the Honey Bears.</p>
<p>The Polar or White Bear is the only
representative of the first class. This
species has been wonderfully provided for
by Nature. Living as it does in the regions
of perpetual ice and snow, the pure
white color of its fur becomes a protection,
as it is less easily observed. It also,
unlike the other species, has the soles of
its feet covered with hair which enables
it to move more freely and safely on the
ice. They have been noted at a distance
of fully fifty miles from the nearest shore,
swimming without effort and showing no
fatigue.</p>
<p>One of the best known of the Land
Bears is the Brown Bear of Northern
Europe and Asia. It varies greatly and
some authorities divide it into several distinct
species. It is easily tamed and because
of the ease with which it supports
itself on its hind feet it is often taught
to step to the sound of music. Here also
is classed the Grizzly Bear, which is nearly
as large as the Polar Bear and much
more ferocious. It has been known to
attack the bison and carry a body weighing
one thousand pounds or more to its
den some distance away.</p>
<p>The Black Bear of our illustration is
also a member of this class. It is a native
of the wooded parts of North America.
This species is timid though agile, strong
and is of great endurance. Its fur is soft
and even and shining black in color. It
can run more swiftly than can a man and
will escape in this manner if possible.</p>
<p>Though it principally feeds on herbs,
fruits and grains, it will also devour live
stock of the smaller kinds and may even
attack cattle. In captivity they are much
better natured than the other species.
&ldquo;They never make hostile use of their
strength in their relations with their
keepers, but completely acknowledge human
supremacy and present no difficulties
in their training. At any rate, they
fear their keeper more than he does
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third class is illustrated by a single
species, the Sloth, or Honey Bear,
also called the Aswal. It is a native of
India and frequents hilly localities. It
feeds upon fruits, honey and the lower
animals, such as ants and the grubs of
various insects. It also enjoys the comb
and honey of bees. With its large and
scythe-shaped claws it will destroy the
strongly built homes of the white ants.
In its native country the Sloth is trained
by jugglers to perform many tricks and
in captivity it is docile and comparatively
good-natured.</p>

<h2 id="c14">BIRD INCIDENTS.</h2>
<p>Wrens versus Sparrows: Some time
since in the early spring, a pair of English
Sparrows made up their minds to
take possession of a bird house in our garden
which a pair of Wrens had occupied
for two previous years.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wren had not yet arrived,
so there was none to dispute the sparrows&rsquo;
right or suspend operations. All
went well and the nest was nearing completion,
when one bright sunny morning,
the former occupants arrived on the
scene and trouble at once began. They
evidently resented the action of the sparrows
in taking the house which they anticipated
using for a summer residence.
An indictment of evacuation was at once
served and being met by a show of sparrow
impudence, forcible expulsion was
next in order.</p>
<p>Mr. Wren took up his position on the
front porch of the little house, and by a
series of savage attacks and much loud
scolding, succeeded in keeping the pair
of sparrows off, while Mrs. Wren, working
with desperate determination, proceeded
to tear the nest apart and carrying
the materials out the little back door,
scattered them in all directions. My!
what a shower of hay, straw, feathers,
sticks, etc. This was continued until the
house was entirely cleared. Then, without
delay, began the process of reconstruction.
During this time the sparrows
did not sit idly by and see their
work destroyed, but there was a continuous
battle between them, and when the
action became too pressing, both Wrens
would make a grand charge which invariably
resulted in driving the enemy back.
By and by the new nest was finished, and
although bad feeling existed for several
days afterward, with frequent passages
at arms, the sparrows finally gave up the
fight as hopeless, and Mr. Wren mounted
the chimney, standing guard, and at the
same time giving vent to his feelings in
loud and spirited song. Of course, our
sympathies were with the victors.</p>
<p>Cat Bird and Cherry Stone: During
one of my many rambles through the
woods, I discovered the nest of a Cat
Bird in a thick clump of briars and upon
drawing near found it contained four little
ones. Retreating for a short distance,
I stopped and watched the mother bird
who was greatly excited at first, but seeing
that I meant no harm to her little
family, she proceeded with household
matters.</p>
<p>After giving the young ones two or
three worms and other choice morsels,
she brought a good-size red cherry and
offered it to one of the nestlings. The
little bird could not swallow it, so what
did the mother do but take the cherry
out of its mouth, remove the stone with
her beak and feet, and then give it back
to the nestling in a crushed state. This
time it disappeared in a trice. The incident
impressed me as being not only
amusing but an excellent illustration of
&ldquo;bird sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chippies Dividing Crumbs: While
sitting under a shade tree in the yard, I
observed a pair of Chippies eating two
crumbs of bread. One crumb was much
larger than the other, and of course the
bird having the smaller one finished first.
Then what! Simply this, the other Chippy
at once broke his crumb in half and
proceeded to place a portion of it within
reach of his mate. In this way each had
nearly an equal amount. Beautiful incident;
well might man take this lesson
home to himself; what an exhibition of
love and generosity; what a different
world this would be if people acted more
on the principle of these innocent little
birds!</p>

<h2 id="c16">SNAILS OF POND, RIVER AND BROOK.</h2>
<p>Many of my readers have doubtless
kept an aquarium at some time in their
life and have stocked it with several goldfish,
a small turtle and some fresh-water
snails. They have also, without doubt,
stood in front of the aquarium and
watched the strange antics of each of the
three kinds of animals and have wondered
at the swiftness with which the little
snails progressed about the glass sides of
the artificial pond. It is of these molluscan
denizens of fresh water that I shall
write in this article.</p>
<p>In the fresh-water species the shell is
not often rounded like that of the land
snails, but is more frequently long and
pointed, the spire resembling a church
steeple. The animal, too, differs very
greatly, the tentacles being either flat and
triangular or long and very tapering. The
eyes are not placed at the end of the eye-peduncles,
as in the land shells, but are
generally situated on little swellings at
the base of the tentacles. They may be
found in almost any body of water, adhering
to stones, sticks, and other submerged
objects, or crawling over the
sandy or muddy bottom.</p>
<p>Our fresh-water snails may be divided
into two classes; first, those which
breathe by means of a lung and which
must come to the surface at regular intervals
to take in a supply of air, and, second,
those which breathe by means of
plume-like gills which take the oxygen
directly from the water.</p>
<p>One of the most common and best
known of the first class is the Limnaeidae,
comprising the pond snails. These animals
have generally a long, graceful shell,
horn-colored for the most part, but sometimes
greenish without and reddish within
the aperture. The animal has a broad,
flat foot, an auriculate or eared head, and
flat, triangular tentacles. The habits of
these animals are very interesting. They
will wander about the sides of an aquarium,
eating the growths of green scum
which have collected. At this time the
mouth may be seen to open, exposing the
radula and the operation of eating is not
unlike the motions of a cat lapping milk.
They are such voracious eaters that the
dirtiest aquarium will be cleansed by
them in a very short time. It is interesting
to note that the young animals
breathe air through the water for a long
time, and finally acquire the normal characteristic
of the family of breathing the
air directly. While submerged, the mantle
chamber containing the &ldquo;lung&rdquo; is
tightly closed so that no water can possibly
get in. It is thought by some that
the species of Limnaea living at great
depths retain the early habit of allowing
the water to fill the mantle cavity and so
breathe oxygen through the water and
are not, therefore, compelled to come to
the surface for air.</p>
<p>Limnaea lives under many varying
conditions, being found in the arctic regions
of Greenland and Iceland as well as
in the tropics, in thermal springs and
those containing mineral matter, as sulphur,
as well as in brackish and fresh
water. They have been found at a height
of over fourteen thousand feet in Thibet
and at a depth of eight hundred feet in
Lake Geneva, Switzerland. During
times of drought when the streams are
dried up and the surface of the mud is
sun-cracked, the species of this family
bury themselves deeply in the mud and
cover the aperture with an epiphragm, in
much the same manner as the land shells.
This fact accounts for the apparent disappearance
of all life from a pond when it
dries up, and its sudden and seemingly
unaccountable reappearance when the
pond is again filled with water.</p>
<p>A genus of pond snails closely allied
to Limnaea, but having discoidal or
spiral shells, is Planorbis, the flat-orb
shells. Instead of dragging their shells
after them, as in the last genus, they carry
them perfectly perpendicular, or perhaps
tilted a little to one side. The animals
are very rapid in movement, more so than
Limnaea, which are rather sluggish.
They delight in gliding rapidly about,
their long, filiform tentacles waving about
like a whip in the hands of an impatient
driver.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The Limnaeas of which we have been
speaking have mostly dextral or right-handed
shells, that is, have the aperture
on the right side when you hold the shell
in the position pictured on our plate. In
the family Physidae the shell is left-hand
or sinistral. The members of this
family have shining, horn-colored shells,
more or less fusiform. The tentacles are
long and filiform and are constantly moving
about as in the allied genus Planorbis.
The animal is very active and moves
about with a steady, gliding motion. It
is very interesting to watch a number of
Physae in an aquarium; as they are
crawling along the bottom, one will be
seen to rise suddenly to the top of the
water and move along with the foot applied
to the surface, the shell hanging
down. Again, they may be seen descending,
suspended by a thin thread of mucus.
When the animal rises suddenly, the
branchial cavity which contains the lung
is heard to open with a faint, clicking
sound, which is probably due to the pressure
of air in the lung being suddenly liberated.
Several of the species of Physa
inhabit water as cold as the freezing point
and they may be frequently seen in winter
gliding over the bottom of a stream
or pond when the surface is frozen. The
little glairy, transparent masses of jelly-like
matter which are seen attached to
stones and the under side of sticks, are
the eggs of Physa or Limnaea.</p>
<p>Not all of the fresh-water pulmonates
have spiral shells. A whole family, the
Ancylidae, have a conical shell formed
like a rounded shield, and resembling the
limpets, hence called the river limpets.
They are generally quite small and live
attached to the interior of dead river
shells and to submerged plants and to
rocks. They are very interesting, but
hard to find on account of their small
size and inconspicuous habitat.</p>
<p>The second class of mollusks or those
that breathe air through the water, have
a respiratory cavity instead of a lung,
in which is placed a series of leaflets, arranged
like the teeth of a comb in two
series of lines, forming the so-called gills.
The mouth, also, is placed at the end of
a long rostrum, or proboscis, and not in
the lower plane of the head, as in the first
class. Among the most common of this
class are the river snails, known as Strepomatids.
There are about three hundred
species in this family, and with two
or three exceptions they are confined entirely
to the United States in geographical
distribution. The shells are more or
less graceful, having long, turreted spires
and small apertures. The color of the
shells is generally a uniform greenish or
yellowish, although some species have
color bands, and the aperture is frequently
tinged with purple or reddish.</p>
<p>The animal is very interesting in captivity.
It is not very bold and will lie on
the bottom of an aquarium with its head
and foot half protruding from its shell, and
its rostrum and tentacles slowly moving
about. Frequently it may be seen moving
along with its head and rostrum bent
down and moving about like a hound on
the scent.</p>
<p>A family closely allied to the last is the
Melaniidae, the animals of which inhabit
the entire world, except North America.
They may be distinguished from the last
family by the presence of little finger-like
digitations on the edge of the mantle.
The shells are generally larger and more
highly colored than those of the last family,
many of them being of a dark chocolate
color and some are of a beautiful
glossy black; some shells are smooth,
while others are ornamented by knobs
and spines. The genus Melania, a
species of which is illustrated on the plate
accompanying this article, is the most
characteristic form.</p>
<p>The largest and handsomest of the
fresh-water snails belong to the two families
Viviparidae and Ampullariidae, the
shells of the latter family frequently attaining
a length of three inches. The animals
of the first family prefer a sandy
beach in a large lake or river, while those
of the second generally live in more or
less muddy rivers, ponds and creeks. A
single genus of Viviparidae (Campelona)
is confined solely to the United States,
east of the Rocky Mountains. Their
shells are generally of a rich grass green
and in certain localities they may be collected
by the thousands. Unlike many of
the snails of which we have been writing,
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
this family is viviparous, that is, brings
forth its young alive, instead of laying
eggs, as in the family Limnaeidae. This
character has given the family its name,
which is certainly well chosen. When
born the shell is about one-sixteenth of
an inch in length and is perfectly transparent.
The animal is very active and
eats voraciously of any vegetation within
reach. Another handsome shell belonging
to this group is the Vivipara contectoides,
which is about an inch in length
and is encircled by several color bands.
It is a common shell in many of our
ponds.</p>
<p>Somewhat larger and handsomer than
the Viviparas are the Ampullarias, or apple-shells
(also called idol-shells and
pond snails). These animals live mostly
in tropical and subtropical regions and
are noted for the tenacity with which they
retain their hold on life. So tenacious of
life are they that instances are known of
their living for several years away from
the water, in this respect resembling some
of the land snails. It is also recorded that
hollow pieces of logwood from Honduras
have frequently contained specimens of
this family alive after a journey of thousands
of miles. They may be said to be
truly amphibious.</p>
<p>The writer has collected in Florida the
large Ampullaria depressa in considerable
numbers. It was noted particularly that
this species furnished the principal food
of the Everglade Kite, a bird inhabiting
the southern part of Florida. Large
quantities of these shells were found
about the nesting places of these
birds, from which the animal had been
neatly extracted without damaging the
shell in the least. The bird is, curiously
enough, provided with a curved bill which
easily fits into the aperture of the mollusk
and extracts the animal with little difficulty,
and the feet and claws are so constructed
that the shell may be firmly held
during the operation. This shell is figured
on the plate.</p>
<p>In Central Africa there is a lake, Tanganyika,
having a length of four hundred
miles and a width of from ten to fifty
miles, and at an elevation of twenty-seven
hundred feet above sea level, which has
one of the most interesting and peculiar
fresh-water molluscan faunas known. It
is thought that at some remote period in
geological history this lake formed a part
of the ocean and that in the course of
time it was cut off from the sea, gradually
became fresh and was finally raised
to its present elevation. The reason for
such a theory is the presence in the lake
of certain molluscan organisms whose
shells closely resemble those of the salt
water family, Littorinidae (Periwinkles).
The fact that certain species of the family
inhabit brackish water and are even subject
to the influence of fresh water, adds
additional weight to this theory. The
shell of this species (Limnotrochus
thomasi) also resembles certain of the
top-shells (Trochus), which are marine in
habitat. Most of the other species inhabiting
this lake are like the fresh water
Viviparas in form.</p>
<p>The animal of Ampullaria depressa is
very curious and interesting when studied
alive. The foot is very wide, almost
square in some positions; the head is
narrow, separated from the body by a
neck and the region of the mouth is produced
into two long, cylindrical, tapering,
tentacular processes, which are probably
tactile organs like the elongated lips of
Glandina, described in the last article. On
the top of the head are placed the two
whip-like tentacles, which are longer than
the length of the whole animal and are
always waving about when the animal is
in motion. Just back of the tentacles the
eyes are placed at the end of two short,
rounded prominences or peduncles.
From the left edge of the aperture extends
the long, hollow, cylindrical siphon
formed by two extensions of the mantle.
On the upper side of the posterior end of
the foot is placed the horny, concentric
operculum or door. When the animal
withdraws into its shell the head first disappears
with its appendages and the
siphon, and the foot is doubled up in the
middle, the operculum shutting in last
and closing the interior against all enemies.</p>
<p>All of the different groups of the mollusca
have their giants and their pigmies
and the fresh-water mollusks are no exception
to the rule. We have thus far
studied the animals of normal size and
the giants. Let us now turn our attention
to some of the pigmies among the fresh-water
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
snails. One of the commonest of
these small mollusks is the Bythinia tentaculata,
the shell of which does not exceed
half an inch in length, and is formed
in a graceful, tapering turret. This species,
like many other European animals,
has been introduced into this country and
bids fair to eclipse many of the native
species in the number of individuals. It
probably first came over with some merchandise,
which was shipped west by the
way of the Erie canal. The snail, once
established in the canal, has had every
opportunity to spread over the entire
United States. The canal is emptied
every year and cleaned and the water,
with its organisms, is allowed to flow into
the little streams and the larger rivers
and thence into Lake Ontario. From this
lake this species has spread so that it is
also found in Lakes Erie and Michigan,
and will eventually spread over the entire
northern portion of the United States.
This is but one of the many examples of
different species being carried by human
agencies from one part of the world to
another.</p>
<p>But there are many species of these
smaller fresh-water snails that are pigmies,
indeed, whose tiny shells do not
exceed an eight of an inch in length and
which require the aid of a microscope to
adequately study their delicate organisms.
These minute animals live on water
plants and on any submerged object.
They vary from long, pointed, steeple-like
shells to those which are perfectly
rounded like a miniature apple. In our
own country these little creatures may be
found in any of our ponds or streams, and
the lively little animals are well worth a
closer acquaintance. They are known
scientifically under the difficult names of
Paludinella, Amnicola, Somatogyrus,
Fluminicola, with many others, and do
not bear any specific English titles.</p>
<p>Much more might be written concerning
the habits and variations of the freshwater
snails. The best way to become
acquainted with these interesting animals
is to collect them alive and study
their various modes of life in an aquarium.
This receptacle need not be an
elaborate or expensive affair. A fish
globe six or eight inches in diameter
makes an admirable aquarium and even
a quart Mason fruit jar has been successfully
used by the writer. The bottom
should be covered to a depth of an inch
or more with clean, fine sand and several
stones should be introduced for the snails
to &ldquo;roost&rdquo; upon. If the aquarium is large
enough a few water plants like water cress
might be introduced to assist in purifying
the water.</p>
<p>The best Mollusks for this purpose are
the Limnaea, the Planorbis, the Physa,
the Vivipara and some of the &ldquo;pigmies&rdquo;
just mentioned. Much can be learned
concerning the habits of our common
snails if a record is kept of everything the
animal does, such as its mode of eating,
what it will eat and the increase in size
from day to day of the little snails after
they are hatched from the egg. If these
creatures could be considered by the majority
of people as living, breathing animals,
performing many of the functions
carried on by our own bodies they would
be regarded with more favor and hence
aquaria would become more numerous
and they would also be studied more intelligently.
The writer has been frequently
amused (and sometimes pained) by the
careless question of some otherwise intelligent
person, when he has been exhibiting
the shell of some interesting
mollusk, &ldquo;Well, really, now, was that
thing ever alive?&rdquo; It is to be earnestly
hoped that this series of articles will
reach many of this class of people and
lead them to a better understanding of
these lowly creatures.</p>

<h2 id="c17">THE ORANGE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Citrus aurantium.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The tree which produces the well-known
Orange of commerce is closely
related to the lemon, the citron and the
lime, and with them belongs to the genus
Citrus.</p>
<p>By some it is supposed that Linnaeus
selected this name, deriving it from a
corruption of the Greek word meaning
cedar-tree, because, like the cedar, it is an
evergreen. By others it is held that the
name was chosen in honor of the city of
Citron in Judea. In ordinary language
the name citron is applied to another species
of the genus, the fruit of which is oblong,
about six inches in length and with
a thick rind.</p>
<p>Many consider that the name Orange
is a direct corruption of the Latin word
aureum, meaning golden; but our best
authorities on the derivation of words
believe that the name, though a corruption,
reached its present form in the following
manner: &ldquo;The Sanskrit designation
nagrungo, becoming narungle in
Hindustani, and corrupted by the Arabs
into naranj (Spanish naranja), passed by
easy transitions into the Italian arancia
(Latinized aurantium), the Roman arangi,
and the later Provincial Orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regard to the original home of the
Orange there is a great diversity of opinion,
yet there is little doubt that it was in
some portion of southern Asia. Both
the Orange and the lemon were unknown
to the Romans, hence they must have
been indigenous in a country not visited
by this people. The region traversed
by them was great and they even penetrated
India. They were a people who
were inclined to please the palate and
would surely have used the Orange and
taken it home with them if discovered and
would doubtless have recorded the finding
of so important a fruit. These facts
tend to prove that the Orange was not
then cultivated in India unless in the remoter
parts. Other portions of Asia were
unknown to the Romans but, with the
exception of the southeastern portion,
climatic conditions would not have permitted
the growth of the Orange.</p>
<p>De Candolle, an eminent botanist and
one the truthfulness of whose investigations
cannot be questioned, held that the
original home of the Orange was the
Burmese peninsula and southern China.
Throughout both China and Japan this
fruit has been cultivated from very ancient
times.</p>
<p>Though not found by the Romans in
India it was later cultivated there and
without doubt it was carried from there
by the Arabs to southwestern Asia previous
to the ninth century and from there
into Africa and to some of the European
islands. The Arabian physicians were
familiar with the medicinal virtues of the
Orange and have spoken of it in their
writings. It was probably afterwards introduced
into Spain and possibly to other
portions of southern Europe by the same
agency as it seemed to follow the spread
of Mohammedan conquest and civilization.
Thus in the twelfth century we find
that the bitter Orange was a commonly
cultivated tree in all the Levant countries.
There is no reference to the sweet
Orange in the literature of this time and
it must have been introduced at a later
period. It was certainly cultivated in
Italy as early as the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>In more recent years the cultivation of
the various varieties has spread throughout
the world wherever the climate and
the conditions of the soil will permit the
ripening of the fruit.</p>
<p>Risso, in his valuable history of the
Orange family, enumerates one hundred
and sixty-nine varieties with distinct
characteristics. Of these he classes forty-three
under the Citrus aurantium.</p>
<p>Besides the sweet and bitter varieties
the more common ones are the Mandarin
Orange of China, a flat and spheroidal
fruit the rind of which easily separates
from the pulp; the Tangerine, which is
very fragrant and originally derived from
the Mandarin, and the Maltese or Blood
Orange, commonly grown in southern
Italy and notable for its deep red pulp.
There are many other varieties that bear
geographical or local names.</p>

<p>Few forms of plant life present to the
beholder more beautiful characteristics
than an Orange tree in full bearing. Such
a tree, in addition to the unripe and ripe
yellow fruit has also numerous white
flowers, which give off their wonderful
perfume, and its symmetrically arranged
branches are covered with rich dark
green leaves. It is a tree that appeals
not alone to the sense of taste but to the
esthetic nature as well.</p>
<h2 id="c18">THE MUSICAL SWAN.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Cygnus musicus.</i>)</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What moonlit glades, what seas,</p>
<p class="t0">Foam-edged, have I not known!</p>
<p class="t0">Through ages hath not flown</p>
<p class="t0">Mine ancient song with gathered music sweet&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">By fanes o&rsquo;erthrown,</p>
<p class="t0">By cities known of old, and classic woods,</p>
<p class="t0">And, strangely sad, in deep-leaved northern solitudes?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>If those living Avian gems aglow
amid the trees that form Earth&rsquo;s emerald
diadem, are the jewels of Nature&rsquo;s crown,
then is the great white swan afloat upon
the ripples of her glistening lakes and
seas, a shimmering pearl amid the chasing
of her silver breastplate.</p>
<p>Yet it was not the beautiful Mute
Swan, most beautiful, most stately, and
most silent of all created beings, that
typified to the men of old the reincarnation
of the poet&rsquo;s soul; neither the
Trumpeter, with its loud clarion, but the
more slender Singing Swan of song and
story, that &ldquo;thro&rsquo; its deathless music sent
a dying moan.&rdquo; It was to this swan
alone that the ancients could attribute the
power of melody&mdash;the singular faculty of
tuning its dying dirge from among the
reedy marshes of its final retreat, where
&ldquo;in a low, plaintive and stridulous voice,
in the moment of death, it murmured
forth its last prophetic sigh;&rdquo; and it was
this swan, too, that inspired the philosopher
Pythagoras to teach that the souls
of poets passed at death into swans and
retained the powers of harmony they had
possessed in their human forms.</p>
<p>M. Antoine thinks that it is not improbable
that the popular and poetical notion
of the singing of the swan was derived
from the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls; yet the traveler Pausanius,
who spake as one having authority,
affirmed the swan to be &ldquo;the glory
of music,&rdquo; at the same time preserving
the following testimony to the repute of
the swan as a bird of prophecy: &ldquo;In the
night before Plato was to become the
pupil of Sokrates, the latter in a dream
saw a swan take refuge in his bosom.
Now the swan has a reputation for music,
because a man who loved music very
much, Kuknos, the king of the Ligyes
beyond the Eridanus, is said to have ruled
the land of the Kelts. People relate concerning
him that, through the will of
Apollo, he was changed after his death
into a swan.&rdquo; From this evidence Pausanius
thus subtracts the weight of his
private opinion: &ldquo;I am willing to believe
that a man who loved music may have
ruled over the Ligyes, but that a human
being was turned into a bird is a thing
impossible for me to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rennie cites, also: &ldquo;In his Phaedro,
Plato makes Socrates thus express
himself: &lsquo;When swans perceive approaching
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
death, they sing more merrily
than before because of the joy they have
in going to the God they serve; but men,
through fear of death, reproach the
swans, saying that they lament their
death and sing their grief in sorrowful
tones.&rsquo; After digressing to assert that no
bird sings when either hungry or sorrowful,
he resumes, &lsquo;Far less do the swans
sing out of grief, which, by reason of their
belonging to Apollo, are diviners, and
sing more joyfully on the day of their
death than ever before, as foreseeing the
good that awaits them in the other
world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles de Kay wrote: &ldquo;Not the magnificence
merely, but the element of superstitious
reverence accounts for the frequency
of the swan as a crest and charge
of coats of arms,&rdquo; stating that in heraldry
the swan runs back through heraldic devices
to totemism, and that among the
&ldquo;oath-birds&rdquo; which wizards of Lapland
called upon in their incantations, the
swan often figured.</p>
<p>It is also asserted that German local
legends retain the idea of the swan as an
uncanny bird, prophetic of death or the
under world, and that the Klagesee, or
Lake of Complaining, near Liban, was
so named from the numbers of musical
swans that congregated there.</p>
<p>Pliny says, &ldquo;Some affirm that swans
sing lamentably a little before death, but
untruly, I suppose, for experience of
many has shown the contrary.&rdquo; But
Aristotle says, &ldquo;Swans are wont to sing,
particularly when about to die, and mariners
in African seas have observed many
of them singing with a mournful voice,
and expiring with the notes of their dying
hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicero affirmed that Lucius Crassus
spoke with the divine voice of a swan
about to die; while Homer makes no allusion
to their singing, but mentions their
&ldquo;flying round the springs of Cayster,
clanging on sounding pinions.&rdquo; Oppian
asserts, &ldquo;They sing at dawn before the
rising of the day as if to be heard more
clearly through the still air. They also
sing on the sea-beach, unless prevented
by the sounds of storms and boisterous
weather, which would not permit them to
enjoy the music of their own songs. Even
in old age, when about to die, they do not
forget their songs, though they are more
feeble than in youth, because they cannot
so well erect their necks and expand
their wings. * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are invited to sing by Favonius,
and as their limbs become sluggish and
their members deficient in strength when
death approaches, they withdraw to some
place where no bird can hear them sing,
and no other swans, impelled by the same
cause, may interrupt their requiem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While on the one hand Julius Scaliger
vituperates Cardan for &ldquo;lauding the nonsense
of the poets, and the mendacity of
the Greeks about the singing of the
swan,&rdquo; Aldrovand cites on their behalf
the testimony of one Frederico Pendasio,
a celebrated professor of philosophy and
a person worthy of credit, who told him
that he had frequently heard swans singing
melodiously while he was sailing on
the Mantuan Lake; also that one George
Braun had heard the swans near London
&ldquo;sing festal songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides this, Mr. Rennie says, Olius
Wormius professed that many of his
friends and scholars had heard them singing,
and proceeded to give the experience
of one John Rostorph, a student in
divinity, and a Norwegian by nation.
&ldquo;This man did, upon his credit, and with
the interposition of an oath, solemnly affirm,
that once in the territory of Dronten,
as he was standing on the seashore
early in the morning, he heard an unusual
and sweet murmur, composed of the most
pleasant whistlings and sounds; he knew
not at first whence they came, or how
they were made, for he saw no man near
to produce them; but looking round
about him, and climbing to the top of a
certain promontory, he there espied an
infinite number of swans gathered together
in a bay, and making the most delightful
harmony&mdash;a sweeter in all his
life-time he had never heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this testimony Goldsmith appends
his personal opinion in the following
words: &ldquo;Thus it appears that our modern
authorities in favour of the singing of
swans are rather suspicious, since they
are reduced to this Mr. George Braun
and John Rostorph, the native of a country
remarkable for ignorance and credulity.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
Goldsmith&rsquo;s own belief was that
the ancients had some mythological
meaning in ascribing melody to the swan,
&ldquo;and as for the moderns, they scarcely deserve
our regard. The swan must, therefore,
be content with that share of fame
that it possesses on the score of its beauty,
since the melody of its voice, without
better testimony, will scarcely be admitted
by even the credulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This better testimony is furnished by
Charles de Kay, who says that modern
bird-lovers have heard the swans of Russia
singing their own dirge in the North,
when, having lingered too long before migration,
reduced in strength by lack of
food, and frozen fast to the ice where they
have rested over night, they clang their
lives out, even as the ancients said.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as we have record of the
Singing, or Whistling Swan from Egypt
to Alaska and the Aleutian Isles, with
testimony of modern scientists as well as
ancient poets in proof of the vocality of
this, the largest of singing birds, the
question becomes one of quality of song
rather than of the actuality of the song
itself. M. Montbeillard&rsquo;s opinion of the
whistler&rsquo;s vocal exertions is thus expressed:
&ldquo;The bursts of its voice form
a sort of modulated song, yet the shrill
and scarcely diversified notes of its loud
clarion sounds differ widely from the tender
melody, the sweet, brilliant variety of
our birds of song.&rdquo; And M. Morin even
composed a memoir, entitled &ldquo;Why
swans that sang so well in ancient times
now sing so badly.&rdquo; It is probable that
the ancients, with due consideration for
the difference in size between the swan
and all other songsters, may have also
given consideration in the same ratio to
the theory of the enchantment that distance
lends; and it is more than probable
that all of this confusion of testimony resulted
from confusion of species; for, as
Charles de Kay explains, observations of
the Mute Swan caused people to assign
the song of the dying swan to the most
fabulous of fables; while Hearne, who observed
the Trumpeter, makes the following
vigorous statement: &ldquo;I have heard
them in serene evenings, after sunset,
make a noise not very unlike that of a
French horn, but entirely divested of
every note that constituted melody, and
have often been sorry that it did not forebode
their death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aldrovand, referring to the structure
of the organs of voice as countenancing
the poetical creed of the singing swan,
says, &ldquo;For when we observe the great
variety of modulations which can be produced
from a military trumpet, and, going
upon the axiom that Nature does nothing
in vain, compare the form of such a trumpet
with the more ingenious mechanism
of a swan&rsquo;s windpipe, we cannot but conclude
that this instrument is at least capable
of producing the sounds which have
been described by the ancient authors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In distinguishing between the Whistling
and Tame or Mute Swans, Bingley
describes this strange form of windpipe,
&ldquo;Which falls into the chest, then turns
back like a trumpet, and afterwards makes
a second bend to join the lungs. The
curve being inside the neck of the
Whistler or Hooper, instead of being an
external adornment, as in the case of the
graceful Mute, in whom</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Behold! The mantling spirit of reserve</p>
<p class="t0">Fashions his neck into a goodly curve,</p>
<p class="t0">An arch thrown back between luxuriant wings</p>
<p class="t0">Of whitest garniture, like fir-tree boughs,</p>
<p class="t0">To which, on some unruffled morning, clings</p>
<p class="t0">A dusky weight of winter&rsquo;s purest snows&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>while with the Musical Swan the gift of
voice is balanced by a corresponding detraction
from personal appearance; for
the straight neck and smaller stature impart,
we are told (alas!), a certain goose-like
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This aesthetic obstacle is, however, successfully
surmounted by the fact that their
songs are uttered mostly at night, when
flying far overhead in the darkness; but
there is no help for the statement of Albertus
Magnus, which must needs be
taken for better or for worse, that &ldquo;When
swans fight, they hiss and emit a sort of
bombilation, not unlike the braying of an
ass, but not so much prolonged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abbe Arnaud, whose observations
were said to be very minute, completes the
list of odious comparisons as follows:
&ldquo;One can hardly say that the swans of
Chantilly sing; they cry, but their cries
are truly and constantly modulated; their
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
voice is not sweet; on the contrary, it is
shrill, piercing, and rather disagreeable.
I could compare it to nothing better than
the sound of a clarionet winded by a person
unacquainted with the instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding then to depict the manner
of their dual concerts, he continues: &ldquo;The
swan, with his wings expanded, his neck
stretched and his head erect, comes to
place himself opposite to his mate, and
utters a cry to which she replies by another
which is lower by half a tone. The
voice of the male passes from A to B flat;
that of the female from G sharp to A. The
first note is short and transient, and has
the effect which our musicians call sensible,
so that it is not detached from the
second, but seems to slip into it. This
dialogue is subjected to a constant and
regular rhythm, with the measure of two
times. Observe that, fortunately for the
ear, they do not both sing at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nuttall is likewise arrayed with the
witnesses for quantity rather than quality
of sound. Of the dying song, he says,
&ldquo;These doleful strains were heard at the
dawn of day or when the winds and
waves were still, and, like the syrinx of
Pan, were in all probability nothing more
than the murmurs and sighs of the wind
through the marshes and forests graced
and frequented by these elegant aquatic
birds.&rdquo; Speaking of the natives of Iceland
comparing their notes, &ldquo;very flatteringly,&rdquo;
to those of a violin, he suggests
that &ldquo;allowance be made for this
predilection, when it is remembered that
they hear this cheerful clarion at the close
of a long and gloomy winter, and when,
at the return of the swan, they listen to
the harbinger of approaching summer;
every note must be, therefore, melodious,
which presages the speedy thaw and return
of life and verdure to that gelid
coast.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;it emits its notes
only when flying or calling on its companions&mdash;the
sound being very loud and
shrill, but by no means disagreeable when
heard high in the air and modulated by
the winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the &ldquo;Peaceful Monarch of the
Lake,&rdquo; Thomas Bewick wrote: &ldquo;Much
has been said, in ancient times, of the
singing of the Swan, and many beautiful
and poetical descriptions have been given
of its dying song. &lsquo;No fiction of natural
history, no fable of antiquity, was ever
more celebrated, oftener repeated, or better
received; it occupied the soft and
lively imagination of the Greeks; poets,
orators, and even philosophers, adopted
it as a truth too pleasing to be doubted.&rsquo;
&lsquo;The dull, insipid truth,&rsquo; however, is very
different from such amiable and affecting
fables, for the voice of the swan, singly,
is shrill, piercing and harsh, not unlike
the sound of a clarionet when blown by a
novice in music. It is, however, asserted
by those who have heard the united and
varied voices of a numerous assemblage
of them, that they produce a more harmonious
effect, particularly when softened
by the murmur of the waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Cassell the voice of the swan &ldquo;is
low, soft and musical, and when heard
from multitudes congregated together has
a very pleasing effect.&rdquo; Shakespeare repeatedly
alludes to the music of the swan
with manifest confidence in its melody;
Pallas, the ornithologist, likens their
notes to silver bells; and Olaffson says
that in the long Polar night it is delightful
to hear a flock passing overhead, the
mixture of sounds resembling trumpets
and violins.</p>
<p>So now, though we no longer know
that the soul of the poet returns to float,
the embodiment of rhythmic grace, before
our mortal eyes as in the years so
long gone by, there yet remains to us the
splendid imagery of that stately form in
spotless plumage against the setting of
the darkening sea, the wonder of that solemn
requiem, and the prophecy and the
mystery of the shadowy orchestra passing
onward in the depths of the midnight
sky.</p>

<h2 id="c19">PEPPER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Piper nigrum</i> L.)</span></h2>
<p class="bq">The pepperer formed an important member of the community in England during the
Middle Ages, when a large proportion of food consumed was salted meat, and pepper
was in high request as a seasoner.&mdash;S. Dowell, Taxes in England, IV. 35.</p>
<p>The plants yielding the black and white
pepper of the market are climbing or
trailing shrubs. The stem attains a length
of from 15 to 25 feet. The climbing portions
cling to the support (usually large
trees) by means of aerial roots similar to
the ivy. The leaves are entire, simple, alternate,
without stipules. The flowers
are very insignificant in appearance, sessile
upon a long, slender, pendulous
spadix. They are mostly unisexual, either
monoecious or dioecious, that is the staminate
(male) flowers and pistillate (female)
flowers are separate, either upon different
branches of the same plant (monoecious)
or upon different plants (dioecious). The
fruit is berry-like, with a thin, fleshy
pericarp enclosing a single seed. The
young fruit is grass-green, then changes
to red and finally to yellowish when ripe.
In southern India the flowers mature in
May and June and the seeds ripen five or
six months later.</p>
<p>Piper nigrum is a native of southern
India, growing abundantly along the
Malabar coast. It thrives best in rich
soil in the shade of trees to which it clings.
It also grows in Ceylon, Singapore,
Penang, Borneo, Luzon, Java, Sumatra
and the Philippines. It is cultivated in all
of the countries named, especially in
southwestern India. Attempts at its cultivation
have been made in the West Indies.</p>
<p>In India the natives simplify the cultivation
of pepper by tying the wild-growing
vines to a height of six feet to neighboring
trees and clearing away the under-wood,
leaving just enough trees to provide
shade. The roots are covered with
heaps of leaves and the shoots are
trimmed or clipped twice a year. In localities
where the pepper does not grow
wild, well drained but not very dry soil
not liable to inundations is selected. During
the rainy season or during the dry
season in February cuttings are planted
about a foot from the trees which are to
serve as support. The plants are manured
and frequently watered during the
dry season. They begin to yield about
the fourth or fifth year and continue to
yield for eight or nine years. The methods
of cultivation differ somewhat in different
countries. The harvest begins as
soon as one or two berries of the base of
the spike begin to turn red, which is before
the fruit is mature. Two crops are
collected each year, the principal one in
December and January, the second in
July and August. The spikes are collected
in bags or baskets and dried in the
sun on mats or on the ground. Ripe
berries lose in pungency and also fall off
and are lost.</p>
<p>Pepper is of extreme antiquity. It received
mention in the epic poems of the
ancient Hindoos. Theophrastus differentiated
between round and long pepper,
the latter undoubtedly P. longum. Dioscorides
and Plinius mention long, white
and black pepper and dwell upon the medicinal
virtues of spices. Tribute has been
levied in pepper. In 408, Alaric the daring
ruler of the barbaric Visigoths, compelled
the conquered and greatly humiliated
Romans to pay as part of the ransom
3,000 pounds of pepper. During the
Dark and Middle Ages pepper was a very
costly article, as is evidenced by the fact
that it was frequently found among royal
presents. The pepper-corn rents, which
prevailed during the Middle Ages, consisted
in supplying a certain quantity of
pepper at stated times, usually one pound
each month. The high price of pepper
was the prime motive to induce the Portuguese
to seek a sea-route to India, the
land of pepper. The route via the Cape
of Good Hope led to a considerable reduction
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
in price. About this time, also,
began the extensive cultivation of pepper
in the Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>The black pepper is the unripe, dried
fruit of the pepper plant. The white pepper
consists of the ripened fruits from
which the pulpy pericarp has been removed.
It is not nearly as pungent as
the black pepper, but it has a more delicate
aroma. Occasionally the dried black
pepper is &ldquo;decorticated&rdquo; by blowing, thus
giving the &ldquo;corns&rdquo; a smooth appearance
resembling the white pepper. This is a
very absurd proceeding, as by this process
the most spicy portions are removed. The
quality of the pepper is almost proportionate
to the weight of the corns; the
lighter the poorer the quality. After the
fruits are dried they should be carefully
winnowed to remove light grains and all
refuse. Very frequently these winnowings
are ground and placed on the market.
Adulteration of pepper is quite common,
especially when ground. A wise
plan is never to purchase ground spices.
Buy them whole and grind them at home
or have them ground before your eyes.
Good whole peppers should sink in water
and should not crumble between the fingers.</p>
<p>There are several commercial varieties
of pepper, as Malabar, Penang, Batavia,
etc., differing considerable in quality.</p>
<p>The pungent taste of pepper is due to
a resin and the odor is due to an ethereal
oil. Besides these there is present an alkaloid
known as piperin.</p>
<p>The chief use of pepper is that of a
spice, added principally to meats, but also
to other food substances. Its use is, however,
less now than it was during the latter
part of the Middle Ages. So extensive
was the dealing in pepper that the English
grocers of the time were known as pepperers.
It was very liberally used with all
meats, especially chopped or sausage
meats. It was used as snuff or added to
snuff tobacco to increase its effectiveness.
It is still highly prized as an aid to digestion.
Applied externally it is used as a
counterirritant in skin diseases. Italian
physicians recommend it highly in malarial
diseases.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">March, thou bully grim and gruff,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever grumbling, hoarse, and rough!</p>
<p class="t0">Always howling at the door</p>
<p class="t0">Of the rich man or the poor;</p>
<p class="t0">Screaming words that do not reach&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Words unlike our human speech.</p>
<p class="t0">Down the hollow chimney-bore,</p>
<p class="t0">Hark the raging tyrant&rsquo;s roar!</p>
<p class="t0">Beat not with thy sleety flail,</p>
<p class="t0">Or the keen lash of thy hail,</p>
<p class="t0">Infant Spring, that tender child,</p>
<p class="t0">Frightened when thou even smiled.</p>
<p class="t9">Cruel March, Sir!</p>
